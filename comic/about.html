    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rstandefer">Robert Standefer</a>. I created the <a href="make-sense-agent-platforms.html">Make Sense of Microsoft Agent Platforms</a> comic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work for Microsoft in the Copilot Acceleration Team (CAT), where I help
      customers make sense of the Microsoft agent platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created the "Make Sense of Microsoft Agent Platforms" comic for my talk
      at Power Platform Community Conference 2025. I created it with the goal of
      introducing some of the concepts of the different Microsoft agent
      platforms, driving a bit of clarity, and getting a conversation started.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important note!</strong> The comic doesn't provide deep guidance
      and you should think of it as an entertaining overview of the topic.
    </p>

    <h1>How did I create the comic?</h1>
    <p>
      I created the comic with Microsoft Comic Chat. Comic Chat was a chat
      program, created by DJ Kurlander in Microsoft Research and released in
      1996, that visually represented conversations in chat as sequences of
      comic panels. Users could chat on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) as comic
      characters, which was pretty groundbreaking in 1996.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comic Chat uses AI (!) to automatically generate comic panels based on the
      text of the conversation. The characters can express
      different emotions based on the text. For example, if the user says, "I
      like that", the character will point at itself. If the user expresses
      anger, the character will frown or cross its arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      A team in Microsoft Research called FUSE Labs worked on Comic Chat. FUSE
      Labs went on to create Bot Framework, which is part of the foundation of
      the Microsoft agent platforms today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comic Chat was discontinued in 2001 and the servers were shut down, but
      you can still use it on modern versions of Windows and connect to IRC
      servers.
